        <p>What it really means to have a supportive partner
            Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you felt supported? When was the last time you felt safe,
            at home, encouraged, and able to be 100 percent yourself?

            If your partner creates a safe space for you to do this, then you are truly blessed. If not, have you ever
            wondered why you don’t feel safe, supported, and loved?

            Two years ago my best friend told me he’d loved me for many years. It was an unforgettable day once I got
            over my initial shock, because for many years I’d felt the same way about him.

            It took me a while to get my head around how the most beautiful man I knew, not to mention one of my best
            friends, wanted me over anyone else.

            In the beginning of our relationship I idolized him. I had an image of him in my head as my friend, and it
            was one of unrealistic perfection, non-stop humor and happiness, and a loving boyfriend who would walk on
            hot coals for me, just as I’d watched him do for other girls.

            I wanted to support him any way I could and would do anything for him, but when we got together—a difficult
            and confusing time for me, for many reasons—I was the one who needed supporting.

            When I didn’t get what I thought I deserved, things began to look very different than I had originally
            imagined. Maybe he wasn’t the guy I thought he was going to be as a partner. Maybe I’d set his pedestal just
            a little too high.

            Had going from friends to lovers been a terrible idea? But what was actually happening at the time was that
            I was leaning on him way too much for support, and I hadn’t even stopped to consider that the person I
            needed to sort out and support, first and foremost, was me.</p>

                    <h3>See an opportunity instead of failure</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Things in life don’t always work out the way that you want them to. Sometimes it’s small snags or
                    setbacks. In other cases disaster can strike – such as the COVID pandemic – and can put you into a
                    state of feeling trapped, lost, and scared. While any level of failure or problems we run into will
                    sting, it’s important for you to seek opportunity during those moments and times. This is something
                    that I constantly do by reminding myself:

                    When something doesn’t work, I choose to see this as an opportunity rather than failure.

                    Here is how you can rewire your brain to create the breakthroughs that you need to overcome these
                    failures.

                    An Opportunity For A Fresh Start

                    One of the marvels of our society is that we continue to develop at faster and faster paces. Even
                    during times where it feels like we’re not going very far, there are many opportunities for us to do
                    things. Things that once were mere thoughts have now been our reality. Time and again, people have
                    broken boundaries and stereotypes alike. The amazing thing about all this is that this has nothing
                    to do with our age or education. All that you have to do is hone your skills and abilities to accept
                    new challenges</p>

                    <h3>Brain dumping</h3>
                </a>
                <p>As solopreneurs, we are susceptible to overthinking. With the number of things we have to juggle, we
                    can easily get overwhelmed. You need ways to release the torrent of thoughts swirling around your
                    head to be able to regain clarity for solving problems. That’s where the brain dump comes in. In
                    today’s article, I’m going to talk about the purpose of a brain dump, some of the benefits, and tips
                    for success with this powerful exercise.
                    Sit down, crack open your journal and start writing. It’s as simple as that. Now, you may find that
                    in doing this, especially at first, it’s hard to start writing. Your mind may wander or you may
                    procrastinate. What I’ve found to help get me going is to set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes. This
                    creates a sense of urgency and gets you writing fast. There can sometimes be a barrier to entry with
                    writing because you’re not sure how to start which causes procrastination. Having a timer is like an
                    external accountability device to help you start.</p>
