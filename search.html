                    <h3>What i really mean when i say im fine.</h3>
                </a>
                <p>It was lovely to see you today. I haven’t seen you in such a long time. So much has happened since
                    the last time we saw each other.

                    You asked me how I was. I politely replied, “I’m fine” and forced a smile that I hoped would be
                    believable. It must have worked. You smiled back and said, “I’m so glad to hear that. You look
                    great.”

                    But I’m not really fine. I haven’t been fine for a very long time, and I wonder if I will ever know
                    what “fine” actually feels like again.

                    Some days are good, some not so good. I’m doing my best to stay optimistic and to keep faith that
                    tomorrow will be better. Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s worse. I’m never prepared for either
                    outcome.

                    I’m doing my best to pretend I’m fine.</p>

                    <h3>Positivity is a path to live on.</h3>
                </a>
                <p>It is true that optimists, or positive thinkers, are at an advantage in life compared to pessimists.
                    This is because of the effect your mindset and attitude have on everything we come across. Our
                    social relationships, our job and also our health are an integral part of our daily life and we can
                    feel how negative and positive thoughts can have a domino effect on everything we do during the day.
                    The way we choose to think, positive or negative, has a great impact on the final outcome and is
                    mirrored in everything we do. Hence the importance of having a balanced outlook on life.
                    Positive thinking is power for your soul.</p>

                    <h3>Brain dumping</h3>
                </a>
                <p>As solopreneurs, we are susceptible to overthinking. With the number of things we have to juggle, we
                    can easily get overwhelmed. You need ways to release the torrent of thoughts swirling around your
                    head to be able to regain clarity for solving problems. That’s where the brain dump comes in. In
                    today’s article, I’m going to talk about the purpose of a brain dump, some of the benefits, and tips
                    for success with this powerful exercise.
                    Sit down, crack open your journal and start writing. It’s as simple as that. Now, you may find that
                    in doing this, especially at first, it’s hard to start writing. Your mind may wander or you may
                    procrastinate. What I’ve found to help get me going is to set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes. This
                    creates a sense of urgency and gets you writing fast. There can sometimes be a barrier to entry with
                    writing because you’re not sure how to start which causes procrastination. Having a timer is like an
                    external accountability device to help you start.</p>

                    <h3>See an opportunity instead of failure</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Things in life don’t always work out the way that you want them to. Sometimes it’s small snags or
                    setbacks. In other cases disaster can strike – such as the COVID pandemic – and can put you into a
                    state of feeling trapped, lost, and scared. While any level of failure or problems we run into will
                    sting, it’s important for you to seek opportunity during those moments and times. This is something
                    that I constantly do by reminding myself:

                    When something doesn’t work, I choose to see this as an opportunity rather than failure.

                    Here is how you can rewire your brain to create the breakthroughs that you need to overcome these
                    failures.

                    An Opportunity For A Fresh Start

                    One of the marvels of our society is that we continue to develop at faster and faster paces. Even
                    during times where it feels like we’re not going very far, there are many opportunities for us to do
                    things. Things that once were mere thoughts have now been our reality. Time and again, people have
                    broken boundaries and stereotypes alike. The amazing thing about all this is that this has nothing
                    to do with our age or education. All that you have to do is hone your skills and abilities to accept
                    new challenges</p>
